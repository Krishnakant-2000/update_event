# Error Handling and Edge Cases Implementation Summary

## Task 8 Implementation Details

This document summarizes the error handling and edge cases implemented for the Event Page feature.

### 1. Authentication Check Before Showing Create Event Form ✅
**Requirement: 5.3**

**Implementation:**
- Already implemented in `EventPage.tsx`
- When user clicks "Create Event" button, authentication status is checked
- If not authenticated, user is prompted to log in
- Form only opens for authenticated users

**Code Location:** `src/pages/EventPage.tsx` - `handleCreateClick()` function

---

### 2. Network Error Handling with Retry Options ✅
**Requirement: 10.6**

**Implementation:**

#### EventService (`src/services/eventService.ts`)
- Added `fetchWithTimeout()` method to wrap all fetch requests
- Provides consistent timeout handling across all API calls
- Improved error messages for network failures
- All service methods now use `fetchWithTimeout()` instead of direct `fetch()`

#### EventList Component (`src/components/events/EventList.tsx`)
- Enhanced error display with contextual hints
- Added `onRetry` prop to allow custom retry logic
- Provides different error messages based on error type:
  - Timeout errors: "The request took too long. Please check your internet connection."
  - Network errors: "Unable to connect to the server. Please check your internet connection."
  - Generic errors: "Something went wrong. Please try again."
- Retry button calls the `refetch()` function from `useEvents` hook

#### EventPage Integration (`src/pages/EventPage.tsx`)
- Passes `refetch` function to EventList component
- Enables retry without full page reload

---

### 3. API Timeout Scenarios ✅
**Requirement: 10.6**

**Implementation:**

#### EventService Timeouts
- Default timeout: 30 seconds (`API_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- Extended timeout for file uploads: 2 minutes (120 seconds)
- Timeout errors return status code 408 with clear message
- Uses AbortController to cancel requests on timeout

#### LocationService Timeouts (`src/services/locationService.ts`)
- Location search timeout: 10 seconds (`LOCATION_SEARCH_TIMEOUT`)
- Distinguishes between manual cancellation and timeout
- Provides specific error message for timeout scenarios

**Timeout Error Messages:**
- Event API: "Request timeout. Please check your connection and try again."
- Location API: "Location search timeout. Please try again."

---

### 4. Form Validation Error Display for All Fields ✅
**Requirement: 10.2, 10.4**

**Implementation:**

#### Enhanced Validation (`src/utils/validation.ts`)
- Added `validateTitle()` function for title field validation
- Updated `validateEventForm()` to include title validation
- Updated `validateField()` to handle title field
- All form fields now have validation:
  - Title: Required, 3-200 characters
  - Description: Required, 10-1000 characters
  - Sport: Required, must be from predefined list
  - Location: Required
  - Start Date: Required
  - End Date: Optional, must be after start date
  - Video File: Optional, format and size validation

#### Form Error Display (`src/components/events/CreateEventForm.tsx`)
- Already implemented: All fields display validation errors
- Error messages shown with ARIA live regions
- Visual error indicators on invalid fields
- Character count for description field

#### Enhanced API Error Handling (`src/hooks/useEventForm.ts`)
- Improved error messages based on HTTP status codes:
  - 401: "You must be logged in to create an event."
  - 403: "You do not have permission to create events."
  - 408: "Request timeout. Please check your connection and try again."
  - 413: "The uploaded file is too large. Please use a smaller video file."
  - 500+: "Server error. Please try again later."
- Field-specific errors from API are mapped to form fields
- Network errors detected and shown with helpful message
- General errors displayed on description field (most visible)

---

### 5. Graceful Degradation for Location Autocomplete Failures ✅
**Requirement: 10.4**

**Implementation:**

#### LocationInput Component (`src/components/common/LocationInput.tsx`)
- Added `autocompleteError` state to track autocomplete failures
- Added `autocompleteDisabled` state to disable autocomplete after repeated failures
- Graceful degradation strategy:
  1. If autocomplete fails, show warning message
  2. Allow user to continue entering location manually
  3. Temporarily disable autocomplete to prevent repeated failures
  4. User can still submit form with manually entered location

#### Error Display
- Autocomplete errors shown as warnings (not blocking)
- Validation errors take priority over autocomplete warnings
- Different ARIA roles:
  - Autocomplete warning: `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"`
  - Validation error: `role="alert"` with `aria-live="assertive"`

#### LocationService Enhancements (`src/services/locationService.ts`)
- Added timeout handling for location searches
- Distinguishes between timeout and manual cancellation
- Provides clear error messages for different failure scenarios
- Gracefully handles network errors

**User Experience:**
- If autocomplete fails, user sees: "Location suggestions unavailable. You can still enter location manually."
- Form remains functional even if autocomplete service is down
- No blocking errors - user can always proceed with manual input

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Authentication Check**
   - Test creating event while logged out
   - Verify redirect to login page

2. **Network Errors**
   - Simulate network failure (disconnect internet)
   - Verify error message and retry button functionality
   - Test retry after reconnecting

3. **Timeout Scenarios**
   - Use browser dev tools to throttle network to "Slow 3G"
   - Verify timeout messages appear
   - Test with large video file uploads

4. **Form Validation**
   - Submit form with empty fields
   - Test each field's validation rules
   - Verify error messages display correctly
   - Test character limits

5. **Location Autocomplete Degradation**
   - Block location API endpoint in dev tools
   - Verify warning message appears
   - Confirm manual location entry still works
   - Verify form submission succeeds with manual entry

### Edge Cases Covered

- ✅ User not authenticated
- ✅ Network disconnection during API calls
- ✅ API timeout (slow connection)
- ✅ Server errors (5xx)
- ✅ Authorization errors (401, 403)
- ✅ File too large (413)
- ✅ Invalid form data
- ✅ Location autocomplete service failure
- ✅ Repeated autocomplete failures
- ✅ Large file upload timeout
