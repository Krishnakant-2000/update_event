- Empty state uses `role="status"`

#### CreateEventButton Component
- Added `aria-label="Create new event"`

- Each suggestion has `role="option"` with `aria-selected`

### 2. Keyboard Navigation ✅

#### EventTabs
- **Arrow Left/Right**: Navigate between tabs with wrapping
- **Tab**: Move to next focusable element
- **Enter/Space**: Activate focused tab
- Proper focus management with `tabIndex`

#### EventCard
- **Tab**: Navigate between cards
- **Enter/Space**: Open event details
- Keyboard events properly handled

#### CreateEventForm Modal
- **Focus Trap**: Implemented complete focus trap
  - Focus moves to close button on open
  - Tab cycles through modal elements only
  - Shift+Tab cycles backwards
  - Cannot escape modal with Tab key

- **Previous Focus Storage**: Stores and restores focus properly

#### LocationInput Autocomplete
- **Arrow Up/Down**: Navigate suggestions
- **Enter**: Select highlighted suggestion
- **Escape**: Close suggestions dropdown
- **Tab**: Move to next field

### 3. Focus Management for Modal ✅

Implemented comprehensive focus management:

```typescript
// Store previous focus
previousActiveElement.current = document.activeElement as HTMLElement;

// Move focus to close button on open
closeButtonRef.current?.focus();

// Trap focus within modal
// Tab and Shift+Tab cycle through modal elements only

// Restore focus on close
previousActiveElement.current.focus();

// Prevent body scroll when modal open
document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';
```

Features:
- Focus trap prevents Tab from escaping modal
- Escape key closes modal
- Focus returns to trigger button on close
- Body scroll prevented when modal open
- All focusable elements cycle properly

### 4. ARIA Live Regions for Validation Errors ✅

#### Form Validation Errors
- All error messages use `role="alert"`
- All error messages use `aria-live="assertive"` for immediate announcement

- Errors appear immediately when validation fails

#### Character Count
- Uses `aria-live="polite"` for non-intrusive updates
- Updates announced as user types
- Warning and error states clearly indicated

#### Loading States
- Uses `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"`
- Loading text announced to screen readers
- Spinner marked with `aria-hidden="true"`

#### Error States

- Errors announced immediately
- Retry button clearly labeled

### 5. Color Contrast ✅

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Test all interactions with keyboard only
2. **Screen Reader**: Test with NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac)
3. **Focus Management**: Verify focus trap and restoration
4. **Color Contrast**: Use browser DevTools to verify ratios

### Automated Testing
1. **axe DevTools**: Run browser extension scan
2. **Lighthouse**: Run accessibility audit (target score ≥90)
3. **WAVE**: Run browser extension scan
4. **Pa11y**: Run CLI accessibility tests

### Browser Testing
- Chrome + NVDA
- Firefox + NVDA
- Safari + VoiceOver
- Edge + Narrator

## Key Achievements

1. ✅ All interactive elements have ARIA labels
2. ✅ Complete keyboard navigation support
3. ✅ Robust focus management with modal trap
4. ✅ ARIA live regions for dynamic content

## Requirements Coverage

This implementation satisfies all requirements from the task:

- ✅ Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements (tabs, buttons, form fields)
- ✅ Ensure keyboard navigation works for tabs and form
- ✅ Add focus management for modal form open/close
- ✅ Implement ARIA live regions for validation errors

4. Test with screen readers
5. Verify color contrast in production environment
6. Review and complete the accessibility checklist
